                    There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very 
                    welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible 
                    to the whole community.

                    You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s

                    would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department

                <p>
                    A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays 
                    in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has 
                    its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, 
                    access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and 
                    volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies 
                    for the museum.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact 
                    us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
