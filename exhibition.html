                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
                  ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and 
                  know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various 
                  constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit 
                  about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

                <p>
                    For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with 
                    the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how 
                    did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of 
                    evolution we have had a framework for exploring and 
                    understanding our place in this world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the 
                    species we know today have evolved our time. 
                    You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures 
                    who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, 
                    and a number of dinosaurs too.

                    From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs 
                    in biology are offering us unique insights into the great 
                    wonders of the tiny world.

                <p>
                    For many people their life expectancy is much longer and 
                    their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth 
                    of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits 
                    we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some 
                    major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin 
                    and the first heart transplant. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only 
                    from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. 
                    Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                    The information revolution is here and robotics and 
                    artificial intelligence are the science of the future. 
                    From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of 
                    robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello and 
                    shake the hand of Rob the Robot.
